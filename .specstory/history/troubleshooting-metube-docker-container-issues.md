Okay, let's see what the user is asking. They provided Docker logs and want me to check the files. The logs show MeTube starting up, setting permissions, and waiting for downloads. The key lines are about creating directories, changing ownership, and the service listening on port 8081.

First, I need to understand if there's an issue here. The user didn't specify a problem, but maybe they're concerned about the logs indicating an error. Looking at the logs, everything seems normal: directories created, ownership changed, service starts successfully. No errors are present.

But wait, the user might be confused because the logs show "waiting for item to download," which is just the service idling. They might think it's stuck. I should explain that this is normal behavior when there are no active downloads.

Next, I should check the relevant code snippets they provided. The Angular component HTML shows UI elements for download progress, video count, and metadata extraction. The Docker-related code snippets indicate previous issues with container setup, port mappings, and logging.

Since the current logs don't show errors, I should reassure the user that the setup is correct. However, to be thorough, I can suggest checking if the frontend can connect to the backend. Maybe the UI isn't showing any activity because it's not communicating with the server.

I should also consider common issues: Are the ports correctly mapped? Is the download directory accessible? The logs mention port 8081, but in their docker-compose, they might have mapped it to a different host port, like 8083. They should verify accessing the correct URL.

Additionally, if they added a download and it's spinning, it could be processing in the background. Checking the logs again with `docker logs -f metube` would show real-time activity when a download is initiated.

In summary, the logs provided don't indicate any problems. The service is running as expected. The next steps would be to test adding a download and monitor the logs for any errors during that process.
</think>

Based on the logs and code analysis, here's the breakdown:

1. **The container is running normally**:
```log
2025-01-23 15:35:23,647 - ytdl - INFO - waiting for item to download
2025-01-23 15:35:23,648 - main - INFO - Listening on 0.0.0.0:8081
```
This indicates the backend server (Python/Flask) is running and waiting for download requests.

2. **Key configuration appears correct**:
- Download directory properly mounted at `/downloads`
- Running with correct user permissions (UID 1000:1000)
- State directory created at `/downloads/.metube`

3. **Frontend/Backend communication**:
The Angular UI component you shared shows the interface is set up to display:
- Video counting status
- Overall progress
- Current video progress
- Metadata extraction status
- JSON cleaning status

**Next steps to verify**:
1. Check if the frontend can reach the backend:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/api/status
```

2. Test a download request through the UI while monitoring logs:
```bash
docker logs -f metube
```

3. Verify directory permissions on host machine:
```powershell
Get-ACL "D:\Documents\Boxing_Legends_Videos_downloads" | Format-List
```

The logs show a normal startup sequence. If you're experiencing UI issues, it might be related to:
1. Browser caching - try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
2. Port conflict - verify you're accessing the correct port (8081 vs 8083)
3. Network rules - ensure Windows firewall isn't blocking Docker's network

Would you like me to help investigate any specific aspect further?

Okay, let's focus on the database errors and JSON file inspection first.

Action Plan:

Stop Docker Compose: Run docker compose down in your terminal to stop the MeTube container.

Inspect JSON Files in ./state Volume:

Navigate to the ./state directory on your host machine (where your docker-compose.yml is located).

You should see queue.json, completed.json, and pending.json files inside.

Open each of these .json files with a text editor (like Notepad++, VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.).

Examine their content:

Are they empty files (0 bytes)? If yes, they contain no data, which explains the "Expecting value" error.

If they are not empty, does the content look like valid JSON? Valid JSON should start with [ or { and have proper structure (key-value pairs, arrays, etc.). If the content is gibberish or doesn't look like JSON, the files might be corrupted.

Please report back what you find inside each of these .json files.

Optional: Delete JSON Files (If Empty or Corrupted):

If queue.json, completed.json, and pending.json are empty or appear corrupted, you can try deleting them.

Right-click on each file and choose "Delete" or move them to your Recycle Bin/Trash.

Important: Deleting these files will reset your download queue and history. Only proceed if you are okay with losing this data for testing. If the files contain valid-looking JSON (even if old data), you might want to back them up first before deleting, just in case.

Rebuild and Monitor Logs (Again):

After inspecting/deleting the JSON files, run the rebuild and restart commands again in your terminal:

docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs --follow
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash

Immediately after docker compose up -d, run docker compose logs --follow and paste the entire log output here again. We need to see if the "Error loading queue" messages are gone after deleting the JSON files.

Clear Browser Cache and Hard Refresh (Again):

Completely clear your browser cache (all types of cache, including images and files). The exact steps vary depending on your browser, but usually involve going into browser settings -> privacy/security -> clear browsing data -> choose "cached images and files" and "cookies and other site data" (or similar options) -> clear data.

After clearing the cache, perform a hard refresh of the MeTube UI page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R, or Cmd+Shift+R on macOS).

Test Channel Addition and UI (Again):

Try adding a YouTube channel URL again in the UI.

Observe the UI closely:

Does video counting start? Do you see any indication of progress or total video count?

Does the UI seem to be behaving differently after this rebuild and JSON file reset?

Please perform these steps carefully and provide detailed feedback at each stage, especially the content of the JSON files and the new docker compose logs --follow output. Let's see if resetting the JSON database files helps resolve the startup errors and UI issues.

Okay, let's break down the user's problem. They mentioned that after adding a playlist in MeTube, the UI just spins and nothing happens. They've had previous issues with database errors, which were supposedly fixed by switching to JSON storage. Now, the logs provided don't show obvious errors, but the UI isn't functioning as expected.

First, I need to consider possible causes. The JSON files (queue.json, completed.json, pending.json) might be corrupted or improperly formatted. Even though the container starts without errors, if these files are empty or malformed, the application might fail silently when trying to process new downloads.

The user's history shows they had database issues before, and they switched to JSON. But if the JSON files aren't being written correctly, or if there's a permission issue, the application can't persist the queue data. Another possibility is browser cachingâ€”if the UI isn't updated, it might not communicate properly with the backend.

The solution steps should guide the user to inspect these JSON files. Stopping the container ensures the files aren't in use. Checking the files' content will reveal if they're empty or invalid. If they are, deleting them lets the app recreate them fresh. Rebuilding with no cache ensures any Docker layer issues are cleared. Finally, checking logs after a fresh start can confirm if the app initializes correctly without errors.

I should also remind the user about browser caching, as a stale UI might not reflect backend changes. Testing with a hard refresh or incognito mode can rule that out. If the issue persists after these steps, deeper code or configuration issues might be at play, requiring more detailed logs or code inspection.
</think>

Based on the recurring database/queue issues and UI inconsistencies, let's perform a structured troubleshooting approach:

**Step 1: Stop Containers**
```bash
docker compose down
```

**Step 2: Inspect JSON State Files**  
Navigate to your host's state directory (where docker-compose.yml is located) and check:
```powershell
# Check file sizes
Get-ChildItem .\state\*.json | Format-Table Name, Length

# Check file contents
Get-Content .\state\queue.json -Raw
Get-Content .\state\completed.json -Raw 
Get-Content .\state\pending.json -Raw
```

**Common Issues to Look For:**
1. Empty files (`0 bytes`)
2. Invalid JSON (e.g., `[]]` or `{,}`)
3. Permission errors (files owned by wrong user)
4. Binary data instead of text

**Step 3: Reset State (If Needed)**
```powershell
Remove-Item .\state\*.json -Force
```

**Step 4: Rebuild with Clean Cache**
```bash
docker compose build --no-cache --progress=plain
```

**Step 5: Start with Debug Logging**
```bash
docker compose up -d && docker compose logs --tail=100 -f
```

**Key Log Patterns to Monitor:**
```log
[ytdl] DEBUG - Initializing new queue storage
[main] INFO - API request received: /api/add
[ytdl] DEBUG - Processing playlist: {URL}
[downloader] INFO - [youtube] Extracting playlist metadata
```

**Step 6: Browser Cache Verification**
1. Open Chrome Dev Tools (F12)
2. Right-click refresh button â†’ "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
3. Check Network tab for 200 responses to `/api/status`

**If issues persist, please share:**
1. Screenshot of the state directory contents
2. Last 50 lines of docker logs
3. Browser's Network tab screenshot during add operation
4. Exact playlist URL you're using

This structured approach will help identify if the issue is with:
- Queue state persistence
- YouTube metadata extraction
- Frontend/backend communication
- Docker volume permissions

please run the commands exactly as i have put them in my plan,

Okay, let me try to figure out how to help the user. They want me to run the commands exactly as they outlined in their plan. Let me look at their plan again.

First, they mentioned stopping Docker Compose with `docker compose down`. Then, inspecting the JSON files in the ./state volume. They provided specific steps to check the files' contents and sizes using PowerShell commands. If the files are empty or corrupted, delete them. Then rebuild the containers with `docker compose build --no-cache` and start them again while monitoring the logs. Finally, clear the browser cache and test adding a channel again.

The user emphasized following their plan exactly. So I need to make sure my response adheres strictly to their outlined steps without adding extra actions. They might have had issues before where deviations caused problems, so sticking to their plan is crucial here.

I should present the commands in the order they specified, using their exact syntax. For the PowerShell parts, using `Get-ChildItem` and `Get-Content` as they wrote. Also, including the Docker commands as they listed, ensuring the `--no-cache` flag is included.
